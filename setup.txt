IBP Craft Demonstration/Pre-Assignment

------------------------------------------

Part A - Create a RESTful Service

Create a rudimentary Library Management system that can manage members, books and borrowings.  Expose this system using APIs and no need to build a UI for this. Operations that should be supported:

Borrowings - CRUD Operations
List of books a member has borrowed with due date
Given a book name, list whether it is available now or when it is due
You can seed members and books data directly into your DB

Pick any programming language, framework, DB (even in-memory DB is good) that you are comfortable with. This should have automated tests including unit/integration tests.

------------------------------------------

Part B - Automation

Create a CI/CD pipeline for the service created. When there is a new check in/commit to your source code repository, this sequence of events should be automatically triggered.

Build job triggered
Unit tests run
Built app is deployed (docker is preferred) in a pre-production environment
Integration tests run
Same app is deployed (docker is preferred) to production.
 
You could use any tooling that you are comfortable with and use a public cloud  (AWS, Google Cloud etc) to deploy your application.

------------------------------------------

Deliverable

Source code and test code preferably checked into a public repository like github, gitlab.
